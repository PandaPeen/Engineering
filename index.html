<h2>Week 2 Blog:</h2>
<p> This week there was plenty of new activities and things to learn.
I learned more about safety and was shown what type of tools we have in the schools'
workshop. We also learned CAD with tinkerCad. With this we will be creating a rube goldberg
machine model. We also had a challenge to replicate an object from home in tinkerCad. I attempted to create
a camera but it did not look as nice as I would've wanted.</p>
