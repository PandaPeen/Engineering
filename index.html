        <td> This week there was plenty of new activities and things to learn.
            I learned more about safety and was shown what type of tools we have in the schools'
            workshop. We also learned CAD with tinkerCad. With this we will be creating a rube goldberg
            machine model. We also had a challenge to replicate an object from home in tinkerCad. I attempted to create
            a camera, but it did not look as nice as I would've wanted.

        <td>This was a short week as we had monday off because of Labor Day and had a Friday minimum
            day. This week we finished touching up our 3d models of the Rube Goldberg machines in TinkerCad.
            This week's challenge was to accurately measure the letter 'E' onto a piece of paper.
            We then traded with another person and had to redraw their measured 'E' and copy their measurements
            and cut it out.I think I measured my letter 'E' very accurately in centimeters.</td>
