<h2>Week 2 Blog:</h2>
<p style = "font-size: 20px;"> This week there was plenty of new activities and things to learn.
I learned more about safety and was shown what type of tools we have in the schools'
workshop.<br/> We also learned CAD with tinkerCad. With this we will be creating a rube goldberg
machine model. We also had a challenge to replicate an object from home in tinkerCad. I attempted to create
a camera but it did not look as nice as I would've wanted.</p>

<h2>Week 3 Blog:</h2>
<p style = "font-size: 20px;"> This was a short week as we had monday off because of Labor Day and had a Friday minimum
day. This week we finished touching up our 3d models of the Rube Goldberg machines in TinkerCad.<br/>
This week's challenge was to accurately measure the letter 'E' onto a piece of paper.
We then traded with another person and had to redraw their measured 'E' and copy their measurements
and cut it out.I think I measured my letter 'E' very accurately in centimeters.</p>
